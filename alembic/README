Alembic Database Migrations
===========================

This directory contains database migration scripts managed by Alembic.

## Common Commands

### Create a new migration (autogenerate)
```bash
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Description of changes"
```

### Apply all pending migrations
```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

### Rollback one migration
```bash
alembic downgrade -1
```

### Show current migration version
```bash
alembic current
```

### Show migration history
```bash
alembic history
```

## Initial Setup

After creating the initial models, generate the first migration:
```bash
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Initial database schema"
alembic upgrade head
```

## Important Notes

- Always review autogenerated migrations before applying
- Test migrations in development before running in production
- Never edit migration files after they've been applied in production
- Keep migrations in version control
