# Legacy Google Scripts Backup

This directory contains backups of the original Google Scripts implementation of Inbox Janitor.

## Purpose
These backups are preserved to:
- Maintain the current working version deployed in Google Scripts
- Provide a rollback point if needed
- Document the evolution of the codebase

## Files
- `InboxJanitor.gs.backup-YYYYMMDD` - Timestamped backups of the Google Scripts code

## Usage
The current working version in Google Scripts should match the most recent backup here.
When making changes to the new version, this legacy code remains untouched and safe.
